Welcome to The Lindy Collection. Over they years I've generated lots of notes and resources that I have personally used to help develop my dancing. It has taken me many years to collect this information and all the time I realized that there's much more that I have to learn. I took the time to put together this site to try to help make this content more accessible for people discovering the dance and to help them find the resources more quickly.

There are several different collections with different focuses.

* [Routines](/routines) are a common way to go a little bit deeper with Lindy Hop. They are a good way to expand your repitoir as well as perform and build community. 

* [Historical Information](/historical_clips) Another important aspect of Lindy Hop that often isn't learned about until people get more involved with the dance is the historical aspects of the dance. Understanding and knowing the origins of the dance and early contributors who created the dance that we all love now is important and I want to make sure those resources are available too. 

* [Solo Jazz](/solo_jazz) is an important element of Lindy Hop, it in itself is a form of dance but it forms the basis for all of our partnered dancing.

* [Aerials](/aerials) are a fun advanced aspect of dance that can be used in competitions and performances. It should not be used socially. This is an aspect of the dance that's not for everyone but it's a passion of mine and was where I started collecting resources and links more formally that then has evolved into this whole site.

This is a place to collect those things so that I can keep track of them for myself. I thought that this might be valuable to share with the community and if you have something to suggest adding please see the contact page or make a suggestion [as an issue](https://github.com/lindycollection/www.lindycollection.com/issues) or contribute directly through a [pull request](https://github.com/lindycollection/www.lindycollection.com/pulls) on Github.
