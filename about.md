* Bill Green has a TON of excerpts of jazz and tap dances on film on youtube, https://www.youtube.com/user/10150924/videos or https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC07XsRsNjrogsOfwSpMGr2A
* The famous lindy hop and swing dance historian Peter Loggins has a youtube channel that I don't know that he updates a bunch: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9dbOaah9cHZqKMYsaRof-Q
* Dance historian Forrest Outtman has a variety of clips from not just lindy hop but some pre-swing dances: https://www.youtube.com/user/ForrestOutman/videos
