# Contributing to Lindy Collection

Thank you for considering contributing to the Lindy Collection. With many hands we can make light work. 

If you have something that you'd like to see on the site please open an issue with as many details as you can provide.

If you are familiar with Jekyll Markdown GitHub pages you're also welcome to open a PR with a suggestion large or small.
The site is still young and evolving and I don't have a lot of guidelines for what's acceptable and what's not right now.
So please suggest things and we'll discuss them.

My biggest constraint right now is that I'd like to keep the site as timeless as possible to not need to make frequent updates to content.
